# Work handoff

Updated: 27 August 2026

This is the short operational recovery point for the autonomous MAIN4 series.
Repository history and checkpoint documents contain the full record.

## Current autonomous block

MVP-1 «Living Path» is complete. MAIN4 has implemented Checkpoint 58 /
TRADE-004 / version `0.0.58`: an NPC trader now physically changes the same
markets and later player quote. Tactical
Combat Prototype and every later roadmap stage remain gated by a separate user
command.

## Completed

- One end-to-end scenario composes an authoritative travelling NPC caravan,
  one-way sighting, approximate-age track, route-backed pursuit, permanent
  degrading remains and deterministic minimal loot.
- Track/remains observations become coordinate-free knowledge and journal
  records with provenance, observation time and confidence.
- A physical carrier returns that knowledge to city A. City B remains empty
  until a copied bundle physically travels the full A-to-B route.
- Delivered remains evidence produces a typed, quality-rated world rumor.
- The complete server truth and player view reproduce for identical seed and
  actions; the player view contains no coordinates or source-caravan identity.
- Checkpoints 43–53 retain their independent regression coverage, including
  persistent catch-up, creature intelligence and earned legendary history.
- TRADE-001 reuses seeded food/water and population, adds five more finite goods
  and guarantees one deterministic surplus and deficit flow per city.
- TRADE-002 derives city buy/sell quotes from thirty-day target demand, current
  stock, `0.5x..3x` scarcity bounds and a fixed 10% spread.
- TRADE-003 changes the same markets through capacity-limited purchase and sale,
  requires physical route completion and retains cost basis for route profit.
- TRADE-004 orchestrates those same operations for an NPC and proves its
  destination delivery changes the price subsequently quoted to the player.

## Last known good main

- `cfa92c9009e1abe8685cfe78b80df785da6a7a54` — merge of PR #62;
  tree `35c8b60ed3840723024043252bffe92bcd7ae29a`.
- `main` exactly matches `origin/main`; PR #62 is merged and no PR is open.

## Verification

- TypeScript build: PASS for `sim-core` and `debug-map`.
- Full `npm run verify:local`: `488/488` PASS, zero failures, compiled
  Checkpoint 58 demo PASS.
- Targeted TRADE-004 suite: `6/6` PASS.
- `git diff --check`: PASS.

## Current task

Complete the PR/CI/merge cycle for Checkpoint 58, then implement
`INFO-TRADE-001`.

## Next action

After stable `main`, start `INFO-TRADE-001` in its own feature branch. Quote an
existing physical knowledge bundle against one target library from novelty,
accuracy, age, independent sources/confirmation and strategic evidence type.

## Scope boundary

No tactical combat, PvP, multiplayer, production database, player settlements,
full Magic/System 256, neural agents or broad production-chain simulation.

## Resume instruction

Read `AGENTS.md`, `docs/DEVELOPMENT_WORKFLOW.md`, `TODO.md`, Stage 3 of
`docs/ROADMAP.md`, the relevant knowledge/economy parts of `docs/MVP_SPEC.md`,
this file and the latest checkpoint only. Verify the active branch/PR/main
state, finish any current quality gate, and resume at the first unchecked MAIN4
queue item. Stop after `TRADING-001`; Tactical Combat requires a new command.
